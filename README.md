# ðŸ«€ R-Peak Detection using Digital Signal Processing (DSP)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`DSP_and_R_Peak.ipynb`) demonstrating how to apply digital signal processing (DSP) techniques to electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in order to accurately detect **R-peaks**.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Notebook Overview

The notebook covers the following steps:

- ðŸ“¥ Loading and visualizing raw ECG data  
- ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing using band-pass filtering (e.g., Butterworth)  
- âž• Signal transformation using:
  - Derivative operation
  - Squaring
  - Moving window integration  
- ðŸ“ˆ R-peak detection using `scipy.signal.find_peaks`  
- ðŸ“Š Plotting detected R-peaks on ECG waveforms for visual verification

## ðŸ§° Requirements

Install the following Python libraries before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
